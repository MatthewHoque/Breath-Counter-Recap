# Breath Counter Recap

### Reason / Story
**In about an hour designed this Java application to suit my monitoring needs.**

Jan2020 Had a dog at the time who was terminally ill with congestive heart failure, required constant monitoring / measuring of breaths per minute. Iphone and Android app options were inefficient and cumbersome with lack of simple fluid functionality. 



### Design

Designed with a static dimensions for quick implementation to fit an extra windows tablet I had lying around to serve as the measuring device. 
  - Giant "COUNT" button to easily click while eyes are away from the device and on breathing subject.
  - "Average" breathing rate in breaths per minute displayed as measurements are taken
  - Average of only the last 5 | 10 measurements also displayed for continuous but relevant measuring as breaths per minute changes "locally"
  - Additional data window displayed on the side with breath count ID, time in seconds, and breaths per minute of the individual breath speed associated with ID
